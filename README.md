👋 Hi, I’m Anthony aka boredSoloDev
📫 How to reach me, well... here, twitter @boredSoloDev or email me directly aiszler29@gmail.com 
💻 I have always been great with computers, I liked to make them apart.
I learned some C# and winforms in Highschool, but never bothered to learn programming in depth, I regret it. 
I met a lot of small business owners, who had a good business, but didn't understand computers and the power of the internet (circa 2009)
and I used what I knew to make some custom software to help them with inventory and employee data, as they couldn't understand or afford to pay a company for these services
This struck a fire in me, and I decided to  jump into more advanced programming and system management

- 📖 My story is simple.

- 🎮 I started off with Unity. I had a little c# experience. I enjoyed it, but I wanted to know MORE
- 🖱️ c# locked me into the windows environment, but I enjoyed Linux, so I jumped on the Python train, hooked into web development and found out I have a love for DevOps
- 💻 I am currently working on my A+ and Networking+ certs from CompTIA and I have taking googles certified IT classes to extend my knowledge of all these computers.
- 🪟 I have also started on Azure and AWS compute management stuff, because that is a big part of DevOps
- ⌨️ I am working on a personal website and building a handful of personal CLI tools to help my workflow and learning opportunities. I will get into IT and or programming, and I will be successful!
