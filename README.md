# About Me

Hi there! 👋 I'm anthonyIszler (my attempt at humor), a passionate software enthusiast with over a year of coding experience and a solid 10-year background in IT. I've also spent the last 14 years honing my skills in computer repair. My goal? To transition into a back-end developer role and leverage my IT expertise to build robust and efficient server-side solutions.

## My Journey

🚀 I embarked on my coding journey just over a year ago, and it's been an incredible ride so far. Starting from scratch, I've delved into various programming languages, frameworks, and tools to gain a comprehensive understanding of both front-end and back-end development.

🖥️ I've been using Windows since 2003, which has given me a deep understanding of the Microsoft ecosystem. However, my journey into the world of Linux began around 2011. Currently, I operate on Windows 11 with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and maintain a custom Arch Linux distribution alongside it. This dual-environment setup allows me to leverage the strengths of both worlds.

🔧 My extensive IT background has equipped me with the skills needed to troubleshoot, diagnose, and solve complex technical issues. I believe this experience provides a unique perspective that I can bring to the world of back-end development.

🔌 I've also ventured into the realm of cloud computing with hands-on experience using Linode. Understanding cloud infrastructure is crucial in modern back-end development, and I'm excited to expand my knowledge further.

📚 Currently, my focus is on learning Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is a leading cloud platform, and I'm eager to explore its services and integrate them into my back-end projects. As I progress in my AWS journey, I'll be sharing my experiences and insights here on GitHub.

## What You'll Find Here

👨‍💻 In my repositories, you'll discover a collection of projects and code snippets that reflect my journey as a developer. From my early learning experiments to more advanced back-end projects, I'm excited to share my growth and learning with the GitHub community.

📝 I'll be regularly updating this profile to the best of my ability with new projects, code samples, and blog posts related to coding, back-end development, and cloud computing. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or even collaborate on projects.

👾 I know I have some gaps in my profile, which typically happen when I do deep dive exploration on a new language, or type of development, because a lot of isn't really a project, I don't always upload them, although you may see bits and pieces of the work I have done that doesn't have any real purpose other than playing around with a new platform or language 

## Get in Touch

📫 I'm always open to connecting with fellow developers, tech enthusiasts, and anyone interested in sharing knowledge or collaborating on projects. Don't hesitate to reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-iszler-6081b8257/).

Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to sharing my coding journey with you!

Happy coding, and never stop learning! 🚀
