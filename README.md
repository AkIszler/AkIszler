# About Me

Name, Tony or Anthony (same thing) 
Been breaking computers since 2006 and programming on them since 2020 
Hobbyist
Work in IT
Linux/Windows I don't like MacOs 
I don't to much, my back story isn't exciting, I live where it gets cold so I spend a lot of time indoors playing with random old broken pieces of technology if it's broken I can probably fix it
Spend 3 years working as an Arcade tech where I got to spend my days playing with 80s-current tech.

Married, and boring

Python, Go, and lately Kotlin (I should just get used to Java) 

The best advice I have ever received 
Never stop breaking stuff, and never stop learning! ðŸš€
